# Database-System-Managing-Social-Network

This is a web-based database system for managing social network website: each user is registered with the website with a username, password, first name, last name and an email. Username and email are unique. Each user is associated with a list of hobbies. A user can follow a list of other users and can also be followed by another list of users. Moreover, a user can post a blog, modify the blog and delete it afterwards. Given a blog, another user, and only another user can give a comment to the blog, modify the comment or delete the comment afterwards.  To ensure the quality of the website, each user can post at most 5 blogs a day and each user can give at most 7 comments in one day. For each blog, the user who posted the blog cannot give any comment (no self-comment) and another user can give at most one comment. Each blog is identified by a blogid, subject, description, and a list of tags for search purposes. Each comment is identified by a commentid, a sentiment (positive or negative), and a description.
